In this paper, we study the problem of clustering
gamer's time series.  In particular, we solved two tasks: 
1) identifying gamers' underlying playing states using HMH, 
and 2) clustering gamers' based on their state transitions using
a Dirichlet clustering method. 
We experimented on one of the strategy game developed by Zynga Inc,
and the results reveal interesting results that can help improve the game design.
